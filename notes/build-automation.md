# Build Automation

## What I need to do?

- [ ] Run the build command
- [ ] Create the folder first if not exists!
- [ ] If exists, delete the contents!
- [ ] Copy stuff inside `dist/` to `/dist/auriogold-{PROFILE}-{VERSION}/*.*`
- [ ] Change the assets... (images)
- [ ] Manually change some stuff that need to change... (name & stuff in stuff like `index.html`)
- [ ] Then, zip the whole thing!!!
- [ ] Then move the whole zip thing to the provided path... in config...
